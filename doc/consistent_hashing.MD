# CONSISTENT HASHING

- We've defined a ```ConsistentHashing``` class, which is initialized with a list of node identifiers. Each node is added to the ring dictionary, with its hash value as the key and the node identifier as the value.
- ```add_node``` and ```remove_node``` methods are provided for managing the nodes in the ring.
- ```get_node``` method is used to find which node a given key should be routed to. It hashes the key, then walks the ring clockwise to find the first node with a higher hash value.
- ```_hash``` method is a helper method for generating hash values, using MD5 for simplicity.
In the usage example, we create a ```ConsistentHashing``` instance with three nodes and then use ```get_node``` to find which node a given key should be routed to.

TODO: In a real-world scenario, you might want to use a more sophisticated hash function, handle more edge cases, and add more features to this implementation.
