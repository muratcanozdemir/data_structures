# GEOHASHING

- We start by defining our latitude and longitude intervals, as well as other necessary variables.
- We loop until the desired precision is reached. Precision here is the length of the geohash string.
- In each iteration, we halve the current interval for either latitude or longitude based on whether we are processing an even or odd bit. We use the midpoint to determine which half of the interval the coordinate falls into, and set the appropriate bit in the current character of the geohash.
- We toggle between processing latitude and longitude in each iteration by flipping the even_bit flag.
- Every 5 iterations (since we have a 32-character base, which is 2^5), we add the current character to the geohash and reset our bit and character variables.
- Finally, we return the geohash as a string.

The precision argument in the encode function controls the length of the geohash string. A longer geohash results in greater precision.
